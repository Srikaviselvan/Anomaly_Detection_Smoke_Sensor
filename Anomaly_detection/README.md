<h2>Steps To Execute</h2>

1. Sensor:<br>
   Get a smoke sensor and connect it as per the diagram with Arduino uno or Arduino Nano
   ![image](https://github.com/hr-shloklabs/SHK24-Karunya-visionaries/assets/110014983/5dcec124-ca58-4798-a29e-5eb788be3cc0)
<hr>
2. Arduino IDE:<br>
   Download and install Arduino IDE and run the file "smoke_sensor.ino"
<hr>
3. Pyserial: <br>
   Before running the "dataextractor.py" make sure that you have installed pyserial module.
   Run the "dataextractor.py" file to collect the data. Press "1" to label it as Normal data and Press "2" to label it as Broken data.
<hr>
4. CSV: <br>
   The collected data is shown at serial_data.csv 
<hr>
5. Machine Learning: <br>
   Run the "machine_learning_anomaly_detection" file to run the RandomForestClassifier algorithm and the model will be saved "anomaly_detection_model.pkl"
<hr>
6. Realtime prediction : <br>
   Run the "predict.py" file to predict the status of the machine in realtime.
   Now you can run the "realtime_detection.py" file to connect with the discord server and it will show the anomaly status in the server.
<hr>
7. Realtime alerter: <br>
   Now run the "realtime_alerter.py" file to get the anomaly status with phone call alerter integration.
<hr>
8. Simulating Employee response: <br>
   A text alert will be sent to the server.
   Respond with a üëç emoji to acknowledge the alert message.
   If no one responds within 10 seconds, a phone call will be sent.
   React with a üëç emoji to the alert messages of the respective sensors to confirm they have¬†been¬†fixed.
